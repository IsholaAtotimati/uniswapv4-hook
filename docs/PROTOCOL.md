## Overview
## Overview


`IdleLiquidityHookEnterprise` is a Uniswap v4 hook that automatically moves out-of-range liquidity into a vault (or Aave) while tracking yield for LPs. When the position returns into range, the hook can redeploy liquidity and distribute accrued yield.

Zero if feeds not set or assets not configured; useful for off-chain dashboards.

### Global Index Accounting

Positions now accrue yield using a global index model. Each pool/side maintains an `globalYieldIndex` that is updated whenever the hook collects profit from the underlying strategy (Aave or ERC4626). Idle liquidity is tracked in `totalIdleLiquidity` and only those funds participate in the index. LPs entering idle state have a snapshot of the current index and later earn `delta_index * liquidity / 1e18`. This design removes the need for per-position proportional math on every update and enables high‑performance accounting.

### LP Tracking

The hook maintains a list of all registered LPs (`trackedLPs`) so that tick-range checks can be performed for every position when ticks move. A separate `idleLPs` array contains only LPs currently considered idle, allowing efficient redeployment when positions come back in-range.


## PoolId and PoolKey
## PoolId and PoolKey


- `PoolId` is `bytes32`. In the v4-core types, `PoolIdLibrary.toId(PoolKey)` returns `keccak256(abi.encode(poolKey))`.

- Use the same encoding on clients to compute `PoolId` (the frontend includes a helper that ABI-encodes `(address,address,uint24,int24,address)` and keccak256's it).

## Deployment notes
## Deployment notes


1. The hook's constructor validates its deployed address against `getHookPermissions()` by checking low bits of the address. To deploy a hook that passes the check, deploy using a deterministic CREATE2 address with the required low bits (see Uniswap hook deployment guide).

2. For quick testing, deploy onto a local Hardhat node (chainId 31337); `BaseHook` skips validation on that chain id.

Vaults expose an `asset()` method; the hook will automatically record this address and use it when moving liquidity or paying yield. This lets you configure a pool to operate on the second token in the pair if desired. Using `ethers.js` with a signer that is the hook owner:

await tx.wait();
await tx.wait();
// later `await hook.poolConfig(poolId)` returns (vault, lendingPool, aToken, asset, strategy, lpBP, protocolBP)
// later `await hook.poolConfig(poolId)` returns (vault, lendingPool, aToken, asset, strategy, lpBP, protocolBP)

Functions that change configuration (`setPoolConfig*`) are `onlyOwner`. The owner is set as the deployer in the current `constructor` (Ownable).

- Pool configuration functions now validate that provided vault, lending pool, aToken, and asset addresses are non-zero. A bad configuration will cause the hook callback (`afterSwap`) to revert, blocking swaps. Always set correct addresses or leave the pool unconfigured (`strategy == NONE`).
